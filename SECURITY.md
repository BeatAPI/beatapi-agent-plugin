# Security policy

The plugin must never send a BeatAPI API key through a model prompt or MCP tool
argument. Credentials belong in Cursor/Grok Bot's plugin Configure store, the
supported local credential store, or the `BEATAPI_API_KEY` process environment.

Webhook creation returns a signing secret only once. The MCP server writes that
secret to a new local file with permission mode `0600`, returns only the file
path, and rolls back the webhook if secure storage fails.

Secret files use `BEATAPI_DATA_HOME` when configured, Codex's data directory
when available, or `~/.beatapi-agent-plugin` on other hosts.

Paid task creation, shot editing, and composition are described as paid
mutations in MCP metadata. The plugin never retries authentication,
validation, insufficient-credit, or concurrency failures unchanged.

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature for security reports. If a
credential may have been exposed, revoke it immediately in the
[BeatAPI dashboard](https://beatapi.io/dashboard/apikeys).

The latest minor release is the supported release line.
