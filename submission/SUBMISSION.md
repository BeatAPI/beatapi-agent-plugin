# OpenAI Plugin Directory submission

## Recommended first submission

Submit this release as **Skills only** at
<https://platform.openai.com/plugins>.

Run:

```bash
npm ci
npm run verify
```

Upload `dist/submission/beatapi-video-skill.zip`.

This is the complete official path available without deploying new
infrastructure. The repository's local stdio MCP server is for Codex,
Cursor, and Grok Bot installation and must not be entered as a public MCP URL.

The Skills-only artifact does not include an MCP server. Its public listing and
review instructions must state that users need Node.js 20.19+ / 22.12+, the
globally installed `beatapi@0.2.0` CLI, one-time `beatapi auth login`, and an
absolute `BEATAPI_CLI_PATH`, unless the host already supplies compatible
BeatAPI MCP tools.

## Starter prompts

1. Use `$beatapi-video` to create a music video from my images and audio.
2. Use `$beatapi-video` to turn my product images into a vertical ad.
3. Use `$beatapi-video` to check my credits and task status.
4. Use `$beatapi-video` to inspect and close my existing Realtime Video session.

## Required owner-side portal steps

These are account and legal actions, not repository work:

1. Select the OpenAI organization that will publish BeatAPI.
2. Ensure the submitter has **Apps Management: Write**.
3. Complete individual or business identity verification as **BeatAPI**.
4. Confirm country availability and policy attestations.
5. Upload the Skill ZIP, logo, test cases, and release notes.
6. Include the pinned standalone CLI prerequisite and the one-time-secret
   creation exclusion in the reviewer setup instructions.
7. Submit for review and respond to reviewer feedback.

## Future MCP-backed public submission

The portal requires a production public MCP URL, domain verification,
authentication/reviewer credentials, accurate tool annotations, and a content
security policy. A local stdio process cannot satisfy those requirements.

Before a future **With MCP** submission, BeatAPI should add a hosted HTTPS MCP
service with account-safe authentication. Do not pass customer API keys as tool
arguments or expose a shared service key. The hosted service should preferably
use BeatAPI OAuth or another revocable user-bound authorization flow.
